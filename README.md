# STM32F401CC-Drivers
This repository provides the complete Micro-Controller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) of the STM32F401CC microcontroller, based upon ARM Cortex M4, covering all built-in peripherals. A Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) accompanies, built upon the MCAL, and provides interfaces to many useful device modules.
